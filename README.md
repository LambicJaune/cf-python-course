# TestScripts

This Repository contains all of the different tasks I performed over this course related to Python<br/>

## Exercise 1.1

### Learning goals

- Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
- Prepare the developer environment (called "cf-python-base" here) for programming with Python
- create two simple python programs: hello.py and add.py (performing simple mathsusing user inputs)

### Installations

- Python
- virtualenvwrapper

## Exercise 1.2

### Learning goals

- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for the Recipe app

### Choice of data structure

- I chose to use a dictionary to store each recipe as it allows to store values and objects within itself indexed by indentifiers/keys, this way we can store each value no matter the type with their own key. I then placed all recipes in a dictionary as well for the same reason, it can store other dictionaries and their set of data.
