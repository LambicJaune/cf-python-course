# TestScripts

This Repository contains all of the different tasks I performed over this course related to Python<br/>

## Exercise 1.1

### Learning goals

- Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
- Prepare the developer environment (called "cf-python-base" here) for programming with Python
- create two simple python programs: hello.py and add.py (performing simple mathsusing user inputs)

### Installations

- Python
- virtualenvwrapper

## Exercise 1.2

### Learning goals

- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for the Recipe app

### Choice of data structure

- I chose to use a dictionary to store each recipe as it allows to store values and objects within itself indexed by indentifiers/keys, this way we can store each value no matter the type with their own key. I then placed all recipes in a dictionary as well for the same reason, it can store other dictionaries and their set of data.

## Exercise 1.3

### Learning goals

- Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow

- Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming

- Write functions to organize Python code

### Task 

- Create a programm using functions to collect multiple recipes from the user, storing each as a dictionary with name, cooking time, and ingredients. Unique ingredients are tracked in a separate list, and each recipe is assigned a difficulty level based on time and number of ingredients. Finally, the program displays all recipes in a formatted way and lists all unique ingredients. Skills used: user input handling, loops (for), conditionals (if/else), lists and dictionaries, string manipulation, and formatted printing.
